|:-------|:----------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Aug 22 | 11:40 - 12:10 am | I started by deciphering the first three puzzles with intuition (shifted alphabet, AASCI, Binary) |
| Aug 22 |  2:30 - 3:00 pm  |Attempted the fourth puzzle using a guess and check method based on the location of emojis, wasn't able to figure it out |
| Aug 24 | 10:00 - 10:15 am |Thought about how to shift the first method using AASCI values, put out initial code |
| Aug 27 |  9:00 - 9:30 pm  | Finished the first function to the best of my abilities and put down a rough draft on the second function using AASCI Table |
